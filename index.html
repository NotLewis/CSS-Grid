<div class="about">
<p>Childlike in his innocence but grotesque in form,
    frankenstein's bewildered creature is cast out into a
    hostile universe by his horrer-struck maker. Meeting with
    cruelty wherever he goes, the friendless Creature,
    increasingly deperate and vengeful, detmines to track
    down his creator and strike a terrifying deal.
</p>

<p class="bold-italic">"All I ask is the possibility of love!"</p>

<p>Urgent concerns of scientific responsibility, parental
    neglect, cognitive development and the nature of good 
    and evil are embedded within this thrilling and deeply
    disturbing classic gothic tale.
</p>
</div>

<div class="about-more">
<p>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is adopted for the stage by
    Nick Dear and realised by Danny Boyle in his return to
    the theatre after winning the Acadamy Award for best 
    director for Slumdog Millionaire</p>

<p>For the first time ever, National Theatre Live will 
    broadcast two seperate performances of a production. 
    Throughout the run of Frankenstein at the National 
    Theatre, Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller are 
    alternating the roles of Victor Frankenstein and the 
    Creature. Audiences in cinemas will have the chance to 
    see both combinations, with two broadcasts a week apart.
